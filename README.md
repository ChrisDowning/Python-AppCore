# AppCore

A repository to build a common-core set of features to be used in future Python projects.

Many of these features will need significant tweaking in "real" future projects, or complete removal. This repo serves as a place to test these generic features separately to whatever functionality is actually being targeted in the other projects.

### Features to test:
 - Argparse
 - JSON & YAML I/O
 - DataPackage (and other open standards) manipulation
 - Database interaction
 - Auto-documentation
